# Movie Recommender
A content based movie recommender which recommends you movies based on your selection of a single movie. 

## How it works:
I have used cosine-similarity to recommend movies an user might like based on a movie of their choice which they like. The user is prompted to name a movie they like and based on this, top 10 similar movies are recommended to him from the dataset.

## Install guide:
```
git clone https://github.com/OBITORASU/movie_recommender.git

cd movie_recommender

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

python3 recommend.py
```
