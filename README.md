# Movie Recommender
A content based movie recommender for college project. 

## How it works:
I have used cosine-similarity to recommend movies an user might like based on a movie of their choice which they like. The user is prompted to name a movie they like and based on this, top 10 similar movies are recommended to him from the dataset.
